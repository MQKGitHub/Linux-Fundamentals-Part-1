## 🛡️ Linux Fundamentals Part 1

**Room:** [Linux Fundamentals Part 1 — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(24 April 2025)*  

### 🎯 Objective  
This room introduces the basics of using Linux from the command line.  
The goal was to get comfortable with the terminal, file structure, and running essential commands.

---
### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- Linux command line — Use the terminal to interact with the system and run commands.  
- File system hierarchy — Understand how Linux directories are structured (/, /home, /etc, etc.).  
- Navigation commands — `pwd`, `ls`, `cd` to move around and list contents.  
- Viewing file content — Use `cat` to inspect files.  
- Wildcards — Use `*` to find all filenames of the same type (e.g. .txt, .exe).  
- Searching for files — Use `find` to locate files by name, type, and more.  
- Pattern matching — Use `grep` to search the contents of files for specific values.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Terminal — used throughout to interact with the Linux operating system.  

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- Got a bit stuck understanding relative vs absolute paths.  
- Practising different path styles and echoing results helped my understaning.  
- Also had to get used to commands being case-sensitive — small mistakes caused confusion early on.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned  
- Learned how to confidently move around a Linux file system and manage files using the command line.  
- Understood how to locate files using `find` and search inside them with `grep`.  
- Realised how powerful even basic Linux tools can be for working with large amounts of data.

### 🌐 Real-World Application:  
> Understanding the Linux command line is essential for working with servers, especially in cyber security.  
> Commands like `find` and `grep` are used every day by sysadmins, security analysts, and penetration testers.  
> Many tools run on Linux, and knowing how to move around and manage files is the first step in analysing logs, setting permissions, or writing scripts.

### 💭 Reflections:  
- This was a solid intro to Linux — felt satisfying to navigate purely with commands.  
- Next time I’ll try experimenting more with command flags to see how flexible they are.  
- One key takeaway: being good with the terminal isn’t about memorising commands, it’s about knowing how to look things up and experiment.
