## 🛡️ Linux Fundamentals Part 1

**Room:** [Linux Fundamentals Part 1 — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(24 April 2025)*  

### 🎯 Objective  
This room introduces the basics of using Linux from the command line.  
The goal was to get comfortable with the terminal, file structure, and running essential commands.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- Linux command line – Use the terminal to interact with the system and run commands.  
- File system hierarchy – Understand how Linux directories are structured (/, /home, /etc, etc.).  
- Navigation commands – `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, to move around and view files/folders.  
- File manipulation – `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv` for basic file handling.  
- Viewing file content – Use commands like `less`, `more`, and `head/tail`.  
- Command help – Use `man` pages and `--help` for learning how to use commands.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Terminal — used throughout to interact with the Linux operating system.  
- man — for looking up command manuals and understanding syntax/options.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- Got a bit stuck understanding relative vs absolute paths.  
- Practising different path styles and echoing results helped my understaning.  
- Also had to get used to commands being case-sensitive — small mistakes caused confusion early on.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned  
- Gained confidence in navigating a Linux system using the terminal.  
- Learned how to view, create, move, and delete files and directories.  
- Understood the structure of the Linux file system and where key files live.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:  
> Understanding the Linux command line is essential for working with servers, especially in cyber security.  
> Many tools run on Linux, and knowing how to move around and manage files is the first step in analysing logs, setting permissions, or writing scripts.

### 💭 Reflections:  
- This was a solid intro to Linux — felt satisfying to navigate purely with commands.  
- Next time I’ll try experimenting more with command flags to see how flexible they are.  
- I won’t forget how simple it can be to break things with `rm` if you’re not careful!
